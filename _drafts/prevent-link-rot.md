# What is "link rot"?

**Link rot** is real, it is common, and it is pervasive. Link rot is essentially *the process by which hyperlinks cease to function, usually because the web page or server they point to has moved or has become permanently unavailable*. It has existed since the internet began. 

# Web pages are ephemeral

[Examples of link rot are far and wide](https://web.archive.org/web/20151001235130/http://www.informationr.net/ir/9-2/paper174.html).  [Another study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1472669614000255) found that 70% of links in Harvard Law Review and 50% of links within the United States Supreme Court opinions are no longer viable. [2] If we are to take the internet as a primary resource seriously, then we seriously need to think about undertaking a better way of long-term preservation of link contents.

# Link rot is pervasive

There seems to be no top-level domains (TLDs) that are free of link rot. In [one study that looked at 720,000 pages](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/73808/p97-fetterly.pdf) on a daily basis, in only 11 weeks, 15% of .net domains had rotted links, 10% of .com, .org domains had rotted links, and 5% of .edu links had rotted. [Another study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bmb.2003.494031010165) found that within 24 months, 50% of .com domains and 20% of .gov domains were no longer viable. [1]

# What is the half-life of a link?

There are a number of sources that have looked into the [half-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life) of a website. Random web pages seem to have a half-life of about 2 years [3], legal citations 1.4 years [4], communication articles 3.2 years [5]. Digital libraries have a much higher persistance, as their half-life is about 24.5 years [6].

## How stop link rot

Link rot can be combated in several ways.

1. Use a [digital object identifier](http://www.doi.org/) which provides persistent and actionable identification. The a website under a DOI changes, it can be changed in the DOI service so that the unique DOI identifier always links to the most up-to-date material.
2. Use a [permanent web framework](http://ipfs.io/). Our current web protocol has many nodes of failure, while newer hypermedia frameworks seek a more distributed protocol with builtin content identies that would allow data to permanently be available.
3. Only link to archiving sites like the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/web/) or [perma.cc](https://perma.cc/). **My little program I've written helps to combat link rot by providing a simple and easy way to convert all your links to an archived link.**
