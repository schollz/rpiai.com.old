<h2>Overall design</h2>
<p>Our overall design will center around a computer-generated poem. The computer-generated poem will be dictated via a synthesized human voice in a 
phrasing that is similar to the construction of the poem. The dictation of the poem will be aided by a set of visuals that employ a gradient of
colored backgrounds and foreground showing stylistic dream-like scenes from the poems. A sample of this proposal is shown and detailed below.</p>

<h3>Computer-generated poetry</h3>

<p>Poems were generated using my poetry generator, but I added additional adjectives, nouns, and verbs that were specifically related to the conference mission. I then added a new variable that told the program to rely on these words ~10% of the time. This generated many usable poems, of which I selected the one below for further use, with I believe best fulfills the parameters for "Poem 3" about sharing and trust:</p>


<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>One Must Always Prove Their Bridges</em></strong></p>
A light inherits,<br>
blushes, and it does not return -<br>
the enchanting color of this crystal planetarium.<br>
Like how the somber brick of <br>
communities that water the domestic forests <br>
are trusted.<br>
I get the feeling<br>
they must have lots to imbue to each other <br>
since the value imposes necessity<br>
and necessity equates love.<br>
</blockquote>

<p>I then synthesized human speech to dictate the poem. The audio is below:</p>
<audio controls id="linkAudio">
  <source src="/storyboard/speech_audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

</audio>

<h3>Animation</h3>

<p>Animation will employ the use of static holds, in the style of early limited animations from Walt Disney. For example, here are the first few seconds of the poem media:</p>

<div class="col-sm-12">
<p align="center">

<video width="860" height="540" controls>
<source src="http://rpiai.com/storyboard/animation_sample.mp4" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

</p>
</div>  
<h3>Storyboard</h3>

<p>A story board of the entire poem is already set, so that it will be easy to facilitate the animation. View the full story board for this poem below:</p>
